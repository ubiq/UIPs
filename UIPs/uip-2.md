## Simple Summary

The following is a proposal to simplify the network development fund (NDF) into more useful assets.

## Motivation

While the purpose of the fund is not to speculate in the volatile markets, we have been fortunate to receive many dividends in the form of forks of the bitcoin supply. While many of these may yield little value, the total sum is sizeable enough to warrant action. This proposal is to determine which action to perform with selling of all available forks and what to do with the garnered funds.

## Specification

We can simply leave all the value in bitcoin to allow for more project funding, diversify into ETH to provide liquidity and gas costs for things like bridging or acquire more UBQ for the NDF. There is also the options to continue holding the alternative bitcoins or to abstain from voicing opinions during the vote while still showing participation.

## Implementation

The forks will be exchanged for the winning candidate. This will require 2/3 of the current multisignature signatories to sign off on moving the funds to an exchange. Market rates at the time will be used. If unable to exchange a fork directly for the winning candidate it will be mediated through BTC. The resulting coins will be returned to the NDF.

## Backwards Compatibility

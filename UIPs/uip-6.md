title: Contribute 0.5 BTC from the NDF to list Ubiq, GeoCoin and Sphere on CryptoBridge DEX

## Motivation

GeoCoin developer Dave Mancini has reached out to the CryptoBridge developers to enquire about the potential to list Ubiq, GeoCoin and Sphere on the CryptoBridge DEX. After discussing individually about adding GeoCoin to CryptoBridge they offered our community a discounted price for adding the Ubiq custom protocol and the GeoCoin and Sphere ERC20 tokens to their DEX. The majority of this listing fee has been sourced from donations in the network and community, the remaining portion of the listing fee is 0.5 BTC.

This proposal is to gauge community interest in the CryptoBridge DEX and determine whether the community would be willing to contribute this remaining 0.5 BTC from the Network Development Fund (NDF) to fulfill the listing fee. CryptoBridge operates a DEX built on the BitShares network. This could provide the community with a new non-KYC exchange for international users of Ubiq, GeoCoin and Sphere to trade.

## Specification

We can use 0.5 BTC from the NDF to contribute to this listing fee, choose not to contribute 0.5 BTC from the NDF or to abstain from voicing opinions during the vote while still showing participation.

## Implementation

If the community agrees to use 0.5 BTC from the NDF the funds will be gathered and sent to the CryptoBridge developers for listing Ubiq, GeoCoin and Sphere on their DEX. If the community disagrees the funds would need to be sourced from other providers or the listing application could be abandoned.

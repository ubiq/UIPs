## Simple Summary

The purpose of this proposal is to outline the submission and selection process for all designers who wish to submit a logo design for the bounty.

## Submission Criteria

* Each user will be allowed to submit 3 of their best designs for consideration.
* The designs must be vectors (.svg format) and must be uploaded in a zip file as GitHub does not allow .svg extensions to be attached.
* Users must attach designs as a comment under this GitHub thread.
* Users must declare their discord username so we can contact them about the bounty.

## Selection Criteria

* Depending on the number of submissions, voting may take place over one or two phases. If there are a large number of submissions the top voted options will be taken into round two, to ensure that one option does not win by collecting 5% of the total vote for example.
* If there are a large number of submissions and one option clearly wins by a majority, this will be selected without the need for phase two of voting.
* Voting will take place over a 2 week period for phase one and another 1 week period for phase two if necessary.

## Bounty

150 UBQ will be paid to the winner, upon selection.
